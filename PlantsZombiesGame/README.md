Structure

Program.cs: Contains the main entry point for the console application. Zombie.cs: Defines the Zombie and its derived classes. ZombieFactory.cs: Implements the ZombieFactory to create different types of zombies. Peashooter.cs: Represents the Peashooter class responsible for attacking zombies. Instructions:

Open the project in Visual Studio. Make sure the project is set as the startup project. Build and run the application. Follow the on-screen instructions to create zombies and simulate gameplay.

Gameplay:

Create different types of zombies using the "Create zombies" option. Simulate Peashooter attacks using the "Demo game play" option. View the console output for the updated zombie status.

The project assumes a simplified gameplay scenario. The Peashooter's damage is initially set to 25. Consider potential updates to the code or diagrams based on assignment requirements.
